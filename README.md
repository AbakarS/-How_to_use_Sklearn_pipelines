## Predictive_study_of_the_Titanic_incident

In this tutorial, I explain how to use scikit learning pipelines to find the best machine learning model with the best hyperparameters possible. Then I use this model to make predictions. Once satisfied with the performance of my model, I keep it for a future prediction and especially to deploy it online. 

Here are the steps you will see in this little tutorial:

**1. Exploratory Data Analysis (AD)**

**2. Preprocessing data with Sklearn Pipelines**

**3. Using Sklearnâ€™s GridSearchCV technique to find the best model with the best hyperparameters**

**4. Test the best selected model by making a prediction on a randomly selected sample from the dataset**

**5. Finally, save the template**

**6. Use the flask module to deploy the model**
